## Refactoring
- **TodayView Extraction:** Extracted the "Today" tab rendering logic from `App.tsx` into a new `src/components/TodayView.tsx` component. This reduced `App.tsx` size by ~100 lines and improved modularity.

## Features
- **Temperature Unit Support:** Implemented Celsius/Fahrenheit toggle.
    - Added `temperatureUnit` to `AppSettings`.
    - Added toggle switch in `SettingsModal`.
    - Implemented `convertTemperature` helper in `src/utils/helpers.ts`.
    - Updated `TodayView`, `HourlyForecast`, `DailyForecast`, and `DetailsGrid` to respect the selected unit.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Added unit tests for `convertTemperature` helper using `vitest`.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed a typo replacing `km/s` with `km/h` in wind speed labels, ensuring correct metric display.
- **Bug Fix:** Handled unit conversions for dynamically changing temperature units in `checkWeatherAlerts` and `generateSmartAdvice` ensuring proper values and recalculations of alerts.
